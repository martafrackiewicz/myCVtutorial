# My CV - project

CV project based on tutorial [Fly Nerd](https://www.flynerd.pl/): [CV w HTML / CSS](https://www.flynerd.pl/2018/07/stworz-cv-w-html-i-css-krok-po-kroku.html)

### Motivation

My main goal was to learn HTML and CSS by creating a website with CV. My inspiration and help was the tutorial with this project. With this tutorial I learned basics of HTML and CSS: how to use HTML tags, how to style a website using CSS and how to create a responsive layout.
